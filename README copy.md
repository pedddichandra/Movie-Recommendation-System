# Job Prediction System

This repository contains the implementation of a basic **Job Prediction System** using Python. The project is designed to predict suitable job roles for candidates based on their input data. It demonstrates the fundamentals of predictive modeling with a focus on simplicity and clarity.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to showcase a Python-based implementation of a machine learning model for job prediction. It’s ideal for beginners exploring machine learning and data analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas (Data manipulation)
  - NumPy (Numerical computations)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning)
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (Optional: Visualization)
- **Dataset:** Job-related data (e.g., qualifications, experience, and job roles)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pedddichandra/job-prediction-system
   cd job-prediction-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed, then install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Add your customized dataset file .
   - Format the dataset to include columns like `Skills`, `Experience`, and `Job Role` as needed.

4. **Run the Code:**
   Execute the Python script to train the model and make predictions:
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```

5. **View Results:**
   - Review the model's output in the console.
   - Adjust model parameters or preprocessing steps in the code as needed.

## Project Structure

```

├── model.py       # Core logic for training and prediction
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Usage

1. Edit the dataset or sample input in the code for testing.
2. Run the script to train the model and generate predictions.
3. Modify or expand the code to experiment with different machine learning techniques.

## Limitations

- This implementation assumes a clean and well-structured dataset.
- No deployment or real-time prediction is included; results are console-based.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate advanced algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.
- Add support for feature engineering and detailed visualization.
- Create a user-friendly interface for interaction.
