# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System** repository! This project leverages machine learning techniques and user data to provide personalized movie recommendations. It's an excellent resource for learning about recommendation systems and exploring how to implement one using Python.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Tailored suggestions based on user preferences and history.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies similar to those the user's intres'.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes user-user or item-item similarities for recommendations.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines content-based and collaborative methods for better accuracy.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Handles large datasets efficiently using optimized algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas (Data manipulation)
  - NumPy (Numerical computations)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning)
- **Dataset:** [Movies Dataset] https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pedddichandra/Movie-Recommendation-System
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Dataset:**
   Download the dataset (e.g., MovieLens) and place it in the `data/` directory. Preprocess the data using the provided scripts:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   Launch the application locally:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to see the system in action.
